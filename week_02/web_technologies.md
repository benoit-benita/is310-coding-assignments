### Assignment 1: Inspecting the Web
[For this I decided to look into the UIUC Digital Collections website](https://digital.library.illinois.edu/)
Inspecting their page, I saw they they were using HTML to build the website and the look up tool. 
I couldnt specifically find a github for the archive library but I did find 
[the UIUC Library Github thats connected to 140 different repositories](https://github.com/UIUCLibrary)
It looks like coding wise, the university uses:
- Python
- PHP
- Ruby
- Groovy
- Powershell
